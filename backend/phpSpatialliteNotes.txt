Problem: PHP does not have driver/library to support spatialite functions/datatypes

On Windows WWAMP

#1 Solution: Download spatialite.dll and add to php extensions/php ini; load via loadExtension
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9806804/how-to-configure-wampserver-for-spatialite
download spatialite.dll: http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/windows-bin-x86/
... seems to end in the "Not supported in multithreaded Web Servers" error

as suggested via spatialite (linux-centric): http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-2.4.0-4/spatialite-cookbook/html/php.html

#2 Solution: Download source and compile/make with msys/minGW

On Linux

Solution:
can get spatialite (/dll's) via apt-get


Problem: loadExtension triggers "Not supported in multithreaded Web Servers"

#3 Solution: make sure to include from php.ini, etc. ... do all shown in #1
